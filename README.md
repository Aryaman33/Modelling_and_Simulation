You have been asked to step in as a consultant to help a Chinese company (Chifeng Gold) with a large export contract. While the company is building its new refinery in Chifeng, the company has a contract to send every month 2,000 FEU (40ft container) of preprocessed rare earth ore to Hamburg (Germany). The shipping line operates a large cargo vessel every 2 weeks from Tianjin Terminal. As there is only limited storage and transport capacity in Chifeng and on the Chifeng-Tianjin railway line, the plan is to send every working day on average 91 FEU from Chifeng to Tianjin port. Containers will be accumulated in Tianjin port, and around 1,000 FEU will go every other week per ship from Tianjin to Hamburg. The ship takes 58 days at sea and 2.5 days for loading and unloading. The Container transfer in Germany is not a problem. Perform the research as outlined in the steps 1) to 5) and submit a report describing your research under each of the headings and provide the code required in steps 3) to 5).
